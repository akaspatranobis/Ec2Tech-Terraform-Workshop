Terraform is declarative. You describe what you want, and Terraform figures out how to create it.”

Terraform works with either JSON format or HCL (HasiCorp Configration Langugage)

*.json or *.hcl

1. 	1. Providers
		○ “Providers are Terraform’s plugins to talk to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP.”
		○ Example: AWS provider block.

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}


2. Resources
    ○ “Resources are the actual things you build: EC2, S3, VPC.”
    ○ Example:

resource "aws_instance" "demo" {
  ami           = "ami-08c40ec9ead489470"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "s3" "demo" {
  
}

	3. Variables
		○ “Variables make your code reusable. Imagine hardcoding region everywhere vs. defining once and reusing.”

variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}


4. How do you print anything on Terraform ?

output " " {}
